# NovaSeal v0 RISC-V Shell Artifact Preflight

**Date**: 2026-05-31
**Report**: `target/novaseal-riscv-shell-artifact.json`
**Staged ELF**: `target/novaseal-btc-verifier-riscv-shell-release.elf`
**Status**: staged release ELF is synced to the current release build; BIP340 vector-matching shell; child-verifier and parent-lock CKB VM harnesses exist; parent-lock transaction-shape measurement, official resolved lock-group verifier evidence, official full transaction script-verifier evidence, local devnet pinning, and local TCB review exist; no public/shared deployment attestation or external TCB review yet.

This document records the exact verifier shell artifact that the current lock wiring targets. It does not itself claim CKB VM execution or production readiness; child-verifier VM evidence is recorded separately in `docs/CKB_VM_CHILD_VERIFIER.md`, and parent-lock VM evidence is recorded in `docs/PARENT_LOCK_CKB_VM_HARNESS.md`.

## Command

Run from the package root:

```bash
python3 scripts/novaseal_riscv_shell_artifact.py --sync --pretty
```

## What This Proves

- The staged `target/` ELF is byte-for-byte equal to the current release RISC-V shell build.
- The `.sha256` sidecar matches the staged ELF.
- The shell report matches all 105 IPC vectors: 44 accepts, 61 rejects.
- The shell input contract remains inherited fd index `0`, exactly 18 little-endian `u64` words, 144-byte IPC envelope, and complete trailing-word rejection, implemented over the official VM2 buffer/length syscalls.
- The generated CellScript audit surface exposes lock spawn/pipe/wait records and the manifest-bound spawn target.

## What This Does Not Prove

- This preflight does not execute the ELF; the child-verifier and parent-lock CKB VM harnesses do that separately.
- The parent-lock CKB VM harness now spawns this ELF, observes child status, records transaction-shape tx-size/capacity facts, and runs the official resolved lock-group verifier plus full transaction script verifier for the three parent authority cases; public/shared deployment attestation is still external.
- The `.cell` lock constructs and sends the 18-word IPC envelope to this BIP340 shell in the parent-lock harness.
- The staged ELF is source-package ready in the local evidence stack; public/mainnet deployment still requires public/shared deployment attestation and external TCB review.

The value of this preflight is simple: every VM or transaction run can point at a pinned artifact and a mechanical guard against stale ELF evidence. A small thing, but very much the sort of small thing that saves one from explaining oneself to auditors over cold coffee.

# NovaSeal Devnet Stateful Acceptance

Status: core lifecycle and Agreement originate -> repay / claim live RPC passed.

NovaSeal now has local CKB-VM, `ckb-script`, and `ckb-verification` evidence, but
that is not the same as a live devnet lifecycle. The release gate for this is:

```sh
scripts/novaseal_devnet_stateful_acceptance.sh --pretty
```

The command writes `target/novaseal-devnet-stateful-acceptance.json`. It exits
zero for a local acceptance pass when live devnet RPC execution has passed,
local blockers are zero, and the only remaining stateful blocker is explicitly
the external BTC/Fiber endpoint evidence boundary. Use `--report-only` when a
developer only wants to inspect the readiness report.

Resolved lifecycle blockers:

- Core v0 now has `src/nova_state_lifecycle_type.cell:novaseal_lifecycle`,
  with `OP_BOOTSTRAP` for output-only creation and `OP_KEY_AUTH_TRANSITION` for
  stable identity-preserving transitions.
- Agreement Profile now has
  `src/nova_agreement_lifecycle_type.cell:nova_agreement_lifecycle`, with
  `PATH_ORIGINATE`, `PATH_REPAY_BEFORE_EXPIRY`, and
  `PATH_CLAIM_AFTER_EXPIRY` under one type-script identity.

The required end state is a real CKB RPC lifecycle:

1. deploy the runtime verifier and protocol artifacts as live CellDeps;
2. submit valid transactions through devnet RPC;
3. commit each valid step;
4. verify consumed inputs become dead;
5. verify new state, receipt, and payout outputs are live;
6. keep negative cases as dry-run/send-test rejections that do not mutate state.

Do not classify the current combined transaction harness as devnet stateful
acceptance. It is valuable local verifier evidence, but it is still an
in-memory `ResolvedTransaction` path.

Current live evidence:

- `scripts/novaseal_devnet_stateful_live.py --pretty --ckb-repo ../ckb --ckb-bin ../ckb/target/debug/ckb`
  passed for core NovaSeal.
- The runner deployed the BIP340 verifier and `novaseal_lifecycle` type script
  as live CellDeps, submitted bootstrap and key-auth transition transactions,
  verified the bootstrap state output was no longer live, verified the new state
  and receipt outputs were live, and confirmed a wrong-signature transition was
  rejected by dry-run without consuming the live state.
- `scripts/novaseal_agreement_devnet_stateful_live.py --pretty --ckb-repo ../ckb --ckb-bin ../ckb/target/debug/ckb`
  passed for the Agreement Profile.
- The Agreement runner deployed the BIP340 verifier and
  `nova_agreement_lifecycle` type script as live CellDeps, submitted separate
  originate transactions for repay and claim paths, confirmed
  active/principal-payout/receipt outputs were live, dry-ran wrong signer,
  non-CKB asset, payout capacity, payout lock args, wrong payout amount, and
  early-claim negatives, submitted valid repay and valid claim against their
  exact active outpoints, and confirmed both active outputs were dead plus
  closed/payout/receipt outputs were live.
- The aggregate gate status is `local_devnet_passed_external_endpoint_required`
  when local devnet passes but public BTC/Fiber endpoint evidence is still
  outstanding. It becomes `passed` only after that external endpoint evidence is
  also complete and `blockers=0`.

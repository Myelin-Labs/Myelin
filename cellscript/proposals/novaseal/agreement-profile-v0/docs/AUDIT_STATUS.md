# Audit Status

## Current Status

NovaSeal Agreement Profile v0 is a production-ready CKB-native Agreement source package with
audited terminal-path structure, local transaction-shape evidence, resolved
transaction verifier evidence, live devnet lifecycle evidence, and fixed-width
wallet signing vectors. It now also has a deterministic public profile
certification gate exposed through `cellc certify --plugin novaseal-profile-v0`.
The current source includes explicit checked arithmetic guards for repayment
amounts, terminal nonce increments, and native CKB payout capacity-floor sums.

Primitive-strict 0.16 is clean for the current Agreement Profile bundle. Current
executable evidence is the resolved transaction harness plus the live devnet
lifecycle runner.

## Fixture Honesty

The local harness executes the builder-visible transaction shapes for
origination, repayment, default claim, time rejects, party rejects,
under-capacity reject, wrong-settlement reject, and the four arithmetic boundary
fixtures:

- `repay_principal_max_fee_1_overflow_reject`
- `repay_principal_max_fee_0_accept`
- `nonce_max_increment_reject`
- `nonce_max_minus_1_increment_accept`

The `repay_principal_max_fee_0_accept` case covers terminal amount arithmetic
only. Full payout capacity remains a separate guard because a CKB output
capacity also has to carry occupied capacity.

The legacy action CKB VM harness is no longer part of the current pass/fail
claim because the Agreement surface moved to signed-intent witness shapes and a
single lifecycle type-script entry. The resolved transaction harness and live
devnet lifecycle runner are the current executable evidence.

The resolved transaction harness constructs deterministic CKB transactions,
loads action code and a local always-success lock through CellDeps, and runs both
`ckb-script` and `ckb-verification`. It covers the same terminal-path cases plus
the transaction-layer under-capacity reject. The wrong-settlement fixture is now
resolved-transaction-covered through a typed `NativeCkbPayoutV0` output mismatch.
The harness now fails unless every fixture file is covered by resolved
transaction evidence.

## Receipt Honesty

Receipts are materialized as outputs. The `receipt_hash`/`latest_receipt_hash` value is
carried through state and receipt fields, and receipt output mismatches are
covered by resolved transaction evidence plus the live devnet lifecycle runner.
Fixed-width wallet signing vectors are generated by the root
`scripts/novaseal_wallet_signing_vectors.py` and checked by the compiler-hosted
certification gate together with wallet/lock digest alignment through the
Rust-generated NovaSeal certification report.
Public/shared CellDep attestation, public BTC SPV evidence for BTC-facing
profiles, RWA legal/registry review evidence, and external BIP340 TCB review
remain external public/mainnet evidence for the profiles that depend on them.

## Production Statement Boundary

The current local certification result is sufficient to say that the checked-in
Agreement package satisfies NovaSeal profile certification requirements for the
local evidence set. A public mainnet deployment statement still requires the
external attestations and any profile-specific public BTC SPV or RWA
legal/registry review evidence named by `target/novaseal-production-gates.json`,
plus `cellc certify --plugin novaseal-profile-v0 --require-production`.

# Security Notes

## Implemented Guards

- CKB-only asset kind/hash checks at origination.
- Positive collateral and principal.
- Checked `u64` arithmetic guards before terminal-path `principal + fixed_fee`,
  `nonce + 1`, and native CKB payout capacity-floor additions.
- Local arithmetic-boundary fixtures cover `principal + fixed_fee` max/overflow
  and terminal nonce max/max-1 cases. These are local regression fixtures, not
  production deployment evidence.
- Start timepoint before expiry.
- Origination only during the agreed window.
- Borrower-only repayment terminal path.
- Lender-only default claim terminal path.
- Repayment only before or at expiry.
- Claim only after expiry.
- Status moves from `Active` to a terminal status.
- Nonce increments on terminal paths.
- Receipt output is materialized on every implemented path.
- Typed native CKB payout outputs are materialized for principal payout,
  repayment, collateral return, and default claim paths.
- Terms hash and receipt hash output mismatches reject in resolved transaction
  evidence.
- Local transaction-shape harness checks output occupied-capacity floors and
  CKB economic amounts for origination, repayment, and default claim.
- The legacy per-action CKB VM harness is superseded by the signed-intent
  lifecycle runner; live devnet evidence now checks the terminal lifecycle
  paths directly.
- Resolved transaction harness runs deterministic CKB transactions through
  `ckb-script` and `ckb-verification`, including transaction-layer
  under-capacity rejection.
- Canonical NovaSeal conformance is enforced by manifest schema hash, exact
  canonical field order, wallet signing vectors, and runtime
  `canonical_envelope_hash` recomputation.
- The NovaSeal certification gate fails if Agreement source drops the checked
  arithmetic guard patterns required for value-bearing terminal paths.
- Public ecosystem profile certification is checked by
  `cellc certify --plugin novaseal-profile-v0`, which verifies the NovaSeal
  Rust certification report containing
  `agreement_profile_public_ecosystem_certification_v0`.

## Not Implemented

- Canonical terms hash preimage verification.
- Canonical receipt hash preimage verification.
- Wallet/builder plumbing that maps typed payout outputs to production CKB
  recipient locks and change handling.
- Production wallet authority mapping beyond the current v0 shorthand where
  each authority hash is the BIP340 x-only pubkey used by the harness.
- Cryptographic borrower/lender authority locks outside the local BIP340 verifier
  slice.
- BTC UTXO mirror, SPV, OP_RETURN, or BTC finality.
- iCKB, xUDT, Fiber, or channel execution.
- Dynamic interest, oracle price, margin call, or liquidation bot.

## Risk Posture

The Agreement package is locally certifiable as a NovaSeal profile: canonical
conformance, wallet signing vectors, resolved transaction evidence, live devnet
lifecycle evidence, invariant matrix coverage, and local verifier TCB review are
machine checked by the compiler-hosted certification gate. The gate adds no
Core runtime call and no new chain-facing machinery.

That is still not a standalone mainnet production statement. The production
claim remains blocked until the public/shared CellDep pinning attestation and
public BTC SPV evidence for BTC-facing profiles, RWA legal/registry review
evidence, and the external BIP340 verifier TCB attestation are supplied.
Terms-hash and
receipt-hash preimage policies also remain wallet/builder obligations in this
v0 profile; the chain enforces their bindings to outputs and signed intents, not
a universal terms-document registry.

# NovaSeal BTC Transaction Commitment Profile v0 Devnet Stateful Acceptance

Required local V1 stateful evidence is present in:

```bash
target/novaseal-btc-transaction-commitment-devnet-stateful-live.json
```

The acceptance target is:

1. Deploy the BIP340 runtime verifier and BTC transaction commitment profile
   code as live CellDeps.
2. Submit a valid CKB state transition bound to a public BTC txid/wtxid/output
   tuple and prove the old Cell is dead plus the committed successor Cell and
   receipt are live.
3. Dry-run wrong-committer, zero txid/wtxid, transition-hash mismatch, stale
   nonce, and expired transition negatives and prove they do not consume state.
4. Attach public BTC SPV evidence before any public/mainnet BTC-finality claim. The report must
   satisfy the current external evidence handoff bundle, echo the live CKB and
   service-builder binding hashes, carry the CKB-side BTC commitment hash, and
   include raw BTC transaction, block-header, Merkle proof, confirmation, and
   output-binding material that certification can recompute.

The `btc_transaction_commitment_transition` scenario is now covered in the V1
readiness matrix. Public/mainnet BTC-finality claims still require
handoff-bound public BTC SPV evidence and shared external attestations.

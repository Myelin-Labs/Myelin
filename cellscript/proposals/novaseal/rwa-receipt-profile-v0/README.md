# NovaSeal RWA Receipt Profile v0

**Status**: production-ready source package with live stateful,
operator-fixture, and service-builder evidence. Public/mainnet RWA release
claims still require external attestations and legal/registry review.

This package implements the planned NovaSeal RWA/receipt object profile as a
source-level package with schemas, fixtures, invariant matrix, and security
boundary documentation. It also includes
`src/nova_rwa_receipt_lifecycle_type.cell:nova_rwa_receipt_lifecycle`, a single
CKB-facing lifecycle action for materialisation, claim, and settlement.

## Boundary

The v0 profile models an immutable receipt lifecycle:

- `materialize_rwa_receipt`: issuer creates a materialised receipt Cell and
  event for a non-zero integer amount.
- `claim_rwa_receipt`: holder claims the materialised receipt without changing
  amount or registry/document commitments.
- `settle_rwa_receipt`: issuer and holder jointly settle the claimed receipt
  into a terminal event.

This package does not verify off-chain title, custody, registry state, market
price, legal enforceability, or oracle facts.

## Evidence

| Area | Status | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Separate RWA receipt profile package | implemented | source-guard-present |
| Canonical NovaSeal envelope binding | implemented | source-guard-present |
| Materialise, claim, settle actions | implemented | source-guard-present |
| Integer-only amount model | implemented | source-guard-present |
| Immutable event audit trail | implemented | source-guard-present |
| Stable RWA receipt lifecycle type action | implemented | compiles-to-ckb-elf |
| Schemas and fixture labels | implemented | reviewable |
| Invariant matrix | implemented | reviewable |
| Live devnet materialise -> claim -> settle | implemented | `target/novaseal-rwa-receipt-devnet-stateful-live.json` |
| Profile-specific wallet/service fixtures | implemented | `target/novaseal-profile-operator-fixtures.json` + `target/novaseal-service-builder-fixtures.json` |
| Legal/registry review evidence | external-required | `proposals/novaseal/rwa-receipt-profile-v0/proofs/legal_registry_review_evidence.json` |
| Public/shared CellDep attestation | external-required | public/mainnet deployment evidence |
| External BIP340 TCB review | external-required | public/mainnet deployment evidence |

## Validation Boundary

The V1 readiness matrix may count `object_profile_rwa_receipt` as a package
implementation only when the certification gate sees this manifest, source
actions, lifecycle dispatcher, schemas, fixtures, docs, invariant matrix, and
live stateful evidence. The business scenario `rwa_receipt_lifecycle` now passes
at the live devnet stateful layer, and profile-specific wallet/operator
fixtures are generated and checked by
`scripts/novaseal_profile_operator_fixtures.py`. Service request/response
fixtures are generated and checked by
`scripts/novaseal_service_builder_fixtures.py`. Public/mainnet legal/registry
claims remain external until review evidence is generated and checked.

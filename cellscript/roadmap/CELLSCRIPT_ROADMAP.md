# CellScript Roadmap

**Updated**: 2026-05-09

This roadmap is the high-level planning map for CellScript. It links the
release-specific trackers and the deeper design notes so the project does not
split into unrelated TODO files.

The current project direction is simple:

1. keep the CKB Cell model visible in the language;
2. keep release claims tied to compiler evidence and builder-backed CKB
   evidence;
3. make the language surface easier to teach without hiding authorization,
   capacity, witness, or lock-group boundaries;
4. keep syntax sugar audit-visible by requiring parser, formatter, type,
   lowering, metadata, codegen, docs, and automated syntax-combination gates to
   agree before release.

## Release Tracks

### 0.13: Closed Implementation Scope

0.13 is a closed stable release line. Its implementation scope covers:

- executable stack-backed `Vec<T>` helper support for fixed-width values;
- low-risk surface syntax improvements and cleaner example organization;
- CKB lock-boundary classification with `protected`, `witness`, and `require`;
- 0.13.2 stdlib lifecycle/cell metadata patterns that lower to explicit
  verifier effects instead of core protocol-name magic;
- automated syntax-combination audit coverage for parser, formatter, type,
  lowering, metadata, codegen, and release-gate contracts;
- full release-gate stateful evidence: seven end-to-end business scenarios plus
  action-branch coverage for all production acceptance actions.

0.13 deliberately does not introduce hidden signer authority, hidden sighash
defaults, full generic maps, or cell-backed collection ownership.

Detailed status:

- [0.13 release scope](../docs/releases/CELLSCRIPT_0_13_RELEASE_SCOPE.md)
- [0.13 release tracker](CELLSCRIPT_0_13_TODOLIST.md)
- [0.13.2 release notes](../docs/releases/CELLSCRIPT_0_13_2_RELEASE_NOTES.md)
- [Syntax-combination audit methodology](../docs/CELLSCRIPT_SYNTAX_COMBO_AUDIT_METHODOLOGY.md)

### 0.14: CKB Semantic Completeness

0.14 exposes more of CKB's concrete execution surface without hiding lock/type
boundaries:

- Spawn/IPC builtins for bounded verifier reuse;
- explicit Source views, typed fixed-width lock args, and structured
  WitnessArgs field access;
- target profile metadata for witness ABI, lock args ABI, Source encoding,
  Spawn/IPC ABI, since semantics, CellDep ABI, script reference ABI,
  outputs/outputs_data ABI, capacity floor ABI, TYPE_ID ABI, and tx version;
- declarative since/time and capacity surfaces;
- fixed-Hash dynamic BLAKE2b via `hash_blake2b(input: Hash) -> Hash` with a
  real CKB-profile RISC-V helper and metadata-visible `CKB_BLAKE2B` access.

Detailed status:

- [0.14 roadmap](CELLSCRIPT_0_14_ROADMAP.md)
- [0.14 release notes draft](../docs/releases/CELLSCRIPT_0_14_RELEASE_NOTES_DRAFT.md)

### 0.15: Scoped Invariants And Covenant ProofPlan

0.15 makes invariant scope and enforcement status visible without pretending that
metadata-only declarations are already executable CKB verifier code:

- top-level scoped `invariant` declarations with explicit `trigger`, `scope`,
  and `reads`;
- aggregate primitives for sum, conservation, delta, distinct field, and
  singleton identity relations;
- Covenant ProofPlan records for declared invariants, aggregate primitives,
  selected protocol flows, and pool protocol metadata;
- diagnostics for risky coverage assumptions such as `lock_group` verifiers that
  inspect transaction-wide views;
- macro expansion provenance for compiler-recognized protocol flows.

Detailed status:

- [0.15 roadmap](CELLSCRIPT_0_15_ROADMAP.md)

### 0.16: Formal Semantics And Production Tooling

The `feat/assurance-tooling` branch turns v0.15 audit metadata into an
assurance surface:

- operational semantics in `docs/spec/CELLSCRIPT_OPERATIONAL_SEMANTICS.md`;
- `runtime.proof_plan_soundness` and strict `--primitive-strict=0.16`
  enforcement;
- `runtime.builder_assumptions`, `cellc explain-assumptions`, and
  `cellc validate-tx`;
- template-only transaction plans, deployment plans, dependency locks, proof
  diffs, profiles, transaction traces, and audit bundles;
- standard CKB compatibility fixture manifest for sUDT, xUDT, ACP, Cheque,
  Omnilock, NervosDAO since/epoch, and Type ID.

The 0.17 branch records closure of the 0.16 review findings in
`docs/0.17/review_findings_closure.md`: ProofPlan matching is no longer keyed
only by coarse category/feature/status, `validate-tx` rejects bare evidence
tokens and cross-checks indexed payload fields, protocol stdlib descriptor
stubs are not stable, and `solve-tx` is explicitly `can_submit=false`.

Detailed status:

- [0.16 roadmap](CELLSCRIPT_0_16_ROADMAP.md)
- [0.16 release notes draft](../docs/CELLSCRIPT_0_16_RELEASE_NOTES_DRAFT.md)

### 0.17: iCKB-Grade Protocol Semantics

0.17 moves the protocol-equivalence track from design/model evidence into
executable CKB-facing semantics:

- `--primitive-strict=0.17`;
- HeaderDep SourceViews and DAO accumulated-rate/maturity checks;
- xUDT group amount conserved/minted/burned helpers;
- current script hash, script args/hash guards, OutPoint and MetaPoint bridge
  helpers;
- C256 helper lowering and executable local `u128` materialization;
- iCKB benchmark specs and partial CKB VM differential evidence;
- fail-closed production-equivalence gate with
  `PARTIAL_CKB_VM_EXECUTION` / `NOT_PROVEN` status.

The 0.17 milestone does not claim full iCKB production equivalence. It closes
the major semantic gaps and records the remaining proof closure work for 0.18.

Detailed status:

- [0.17 roadmap](../docs/0.17/CELLSCRIPT_0_17_ROADMAP.md)
- [iCKB final report](../docs/0.17/ickb_final_report.md)

### 0.18: First-Class Script API And Equivalence Closure

0.18 should start by replacing helper fragmentation with typed read-only
ScriptRef / ScriptArgs access:

- `cell.lock.code_hash`, `cell.lock.hash_type`, and args checks;
- optional type script code/hash/args checks;
- exact, prefix, suffix, and hash-based script args comparisons;
- remaining iCKB equivalence prerequisites such as byte-accurate receipt
  decoding, owner-auth witness fixtures, generic aggregate lowering, and
  production evidence-manifest closure.

The goal is to make iCKB-style equivalence verification possible without adding
script construction or deployment solving to the compiler.

Detailed status:

- [0.18 roadmap](../docs/CELLSCRIPT_0_18_ROADMAP.md)

### 0.19: Package Registry Phase 1 And Adapter Boundary

0.19 scope is complete. It turns the CKB ecosystem reuse boundary and Phase 1
package/deployment identity registry into executable evidence:

- centralized inline CKB ABI constants in `src/ckb_abi.rs`;
- parity tests against `ckb-std` / `ckb-types` for constants, SourceView,
  WitnessArgs layout, TYPE_ID, since/epoch, and occupied-capacity field use;
- `cellc action build --json` adapter contracts and packed-materialization
  requirements;
- `cellc ckb-std-compat --json` compatibility reports;
- an offline `examples/ckb-sdk-builder` adapter-shape crate using
  `ckb-sdk-rust` packed types and adapter-owned evidence boundaries;
- namespace-aware package manifests and `cellc init --namespace`;
- Git-backed source registry records with tag-pinned source hash verification;
- path, git, and registry dependency resolution in the compile pipeline;
- `Cell.lock` build identity for compiler version, target profile, artifact,
  metadata, schema, ABI, and constraints hashes;
- `cellc package verify` and `cellc registry verify` fail-closed text and JSON
  verification.

Generated TypeScript builders, live-chain deployment proof, stateful flow
runner evidence, publisher signatures, and on-chain registry/index/proxy design
are moved to 0.20.

Detailed status:

- [0.19 roadmap](../docs/CELLSCRIPT_0_19_ROADMAP.md)
- [0.19 closure notes](../docs/releases/CELLSCRIPT_0_19_CLOSURE_NOTES.md)
- [Registry Phase 1](../docs/CELLSCRIPT_REGISTRY_PHASE1.md)

### 0.20: Generated Builder And Live Registry Proof

0.20 should consume the 0.19 package/build/deployment identity from generated
builders and live-chain verification:

- `cellc gen-builder --target typescript` with typed action APIs and CCC
  integration;
- generated-builder package tests, dry-run/submit modes, and negative
  builder-shape rejection;
- `cellc registry verify --live` / equivalent live-cell verification for
  network-specific deployment facts;
- VS Code and tooling-gate coverage for generated builder creation, package
  verification, registry verification, and generated `npm test`;
- stale/wrong-network/wrong-code-hash/missing-CellDep/deprecated deployment
  rejection fixtures;
- stateful flow runner evidence for canonical examples;
- registry trust hardening for publisher signatures, trust anchors, mutable
  channels, revocation, and possible on-chain registry/index/proxy design.

Detailed status:

- [0.20 roadmap](../docs/CELLSCRIPT_0_20_ROADMAP.md)

### Next Authorization Hardening Track

The next security-sensitive track should make CKB authorization literal before
it becomes ergonomic.

Fixed-width `lock_args` binding to the executing script args landed in the
0.13 line. Remaining planned order:

1. explicit sighash verification primitive with digest mode, script group scope,
   witness layout, and replay assumptions;
2. stable metadata and report fields for signature verification obligations;
3. first-class verified signer values only after explicit primitives are proven;
4. optional `protects T { self ... }` sugar only after protected-input
   selection and lock-group aggregation semantics are exact.

Non-goals:

- no implicit signer derivation from `Address`;
- no hidden sighash defaults;
- no parameter-name-based authority.

- [Surface elegance RFC](../docs/CELLSCRIPT_SURFACE_ELEGANCE_RFC.md)
- [CKB language audit](../docs/CELLSCRIPT_CKB_LANGUAGE_AUDIT.md)

### CKB Evidence Hardening Track

The CKB acceptance surface should continue moving from broad acceptance evidence
to predicate-specific evidence.

Priorities:

- keep action acceptance builder-backed and report-validated;
- keep lock valid-spend and invalid-spend matrices mandatory for bundled locks;
- require invalid-spend cases to match stable script failure paths, not generic
  transaction rejection;
- keep cycles, serialized transaction size, occupied capacity, and malformed
  rejection evidence in reports;
- keep stateful business-flow/action coverage mandatory for full releases;
- extend the matrix when new bundled locks enter production scope.

- [CKB language audit](../docs/CELLSCRIPT_CKB_LANGUAGE_AUDIT.md)
- [Capacity and builder contract](../docs/CELLSCRIPT_CAPACITY_AND_BUILDER_CONTRACT.md)
- [Metadata and production gates wiki](../docs/wiki/Tutorial-06-Metadata-Verification-and-Production-Gates.md)

### Collections And Ownership Track

The collections roadmap stays conservative because CKB Cell ownership is not a
generic heap model.

Completed:

- stack-backed fixed-width `Vec<T>` helper support;
- typed/contextual `Vec<T>` literals for local stack vectors;
- metadata and `cellc explain-generics` visibility for checked instantiations.

Deferred:

- full generic `HashMap<K, V>` and `HashSet<T>`;
- `Vec<Cell<T>>` and other cell-backed linear ownership collections;
- source-level `Option<T>` lowering;
- explicit `Vec<T, N>[...]` bounded-vector literal syntax.

Source documents:

- [0.13 release scope](../docs/releases/CELLSCRIPT_0_13_RELEASE_SCOPE.md)
- [Collections support matrix](../docs/CELLSCRIPT_COLLECTIONS_SUPPORT_MATRIX.md)
- [Linear ownership](../docs/CELLSCRIPT_LINEAR_OWNERSHIP.md)

### Declarative CKB Policy Track

Some CKB facts are currently visible in metadata and builder evidence rather than
first-class source policy.

Future work:

- declarative capacity requirements where the compiler can check them;
- declarative since/header/timepoint assumptions for timelock-like protocols;
- explicit continuity policy for signature-directed input/output Cell updates, including type id,
  lock, data schema, and capacity continuity;
- clearer builder obligations in action builder plans.

Source documents:

- [Capacity and builder contract](../docs/CELLSCRIPT_CAPACITY_AND_BUILDER_CONTRACT.md)
- [Output bindings](../docs/CELLSCRIPT_OUTPUT_BINDINGS.md)
- [CKB language audit](../docs/CELLSCRIPT_CKB_LANGUAGE_AUDIT.md)

### Documentation And Developer Experience Track

The docs should stay useful to new readers and strict enough for reviewers.

Completed:

- GitHub Wiki is version-neutral and cookbook-oriented;
- `_Sidebar.md` gives a book-like navigation structure;
- cookbook recipes and CKB glossary exist;
- LSP and VS Code grammar/snippets cover the new lock-boundary syntax.

Future work:

- keep wiki links rendered through GitHub Wiki URLs;
- add recipes when new stable language patterns land;
- keep release notes in `docs/releases/` and roadmap files in `roadmap/`,
  separate from tutorial pages;
- keep top-level `examples/*.cell` as the single checked-in bundled business
  source, with `examples/language/*.cell` and `examples/ickb_benchmark/*.cell`
  for compiler/tooling and benchmark coverage.

Source documents:

- [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/tsukifune-kosei/CellScript/wiki)
- [Surface elegance RFC](../docs/CELLSCRIPT_SURFACE_ELEGANCE_RFC.md)

## Roadmap Discipline

Roadmap entries should follow these rules:

- completed work must point to tests, release notes, or evidence reports;
- deferred work must say why it is deferred;
- security-sensitive syntax must distinguish data source from authority;
- CKB production claims must distinguish compiler evidence from chain evidence;
- wiki pages should teach the current stable surface, not act as release notes.

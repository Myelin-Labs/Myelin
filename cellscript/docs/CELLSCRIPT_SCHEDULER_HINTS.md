# CellScript Scheduler Hints

**Status**: production metadata contract for the current CellScript CKB profile.

CellScript emits scheduler-facing metadata for CKB. These hints are not hidden
comments; they are part of action metadata and the Molecule scheduler witness.

## Exposed Fields

Each action can expose:

- effect class
- `parallelizable`
- `touches_shared`
- estimated cycles
- scheduler-visible input/output/cell-dep accesses
- binding hashes for conflict grouping

Updating shared state sets `parallelizable = false` and records input/output
accesses for the affected shared-state binding.

## Consumption Boundary

The compiler and metadata make the hints available. Production schedulers,
wallets, builders, and devnet acceptance must consume them according to their
policy.

The supported policy boundary is:

- admission tooling may group or reject actions based on shared touch sets
- wallet/build tooling may use estimated cycles for budget summaries
- acceptance reports must preserve scheduler witness evidence for bundled
  examples

Consensus-level scheduler enforcement is a chain/runtime concern and is not
claimed by the compiler alone.

## Policy Report

Use:

```bash
cellc scheduler-plan contract.cell --target-profile ckb
```

The report consumes action scheduler hints and emits:

- actions that require serial admission because `parallelizable = false`
- shared touch-set conflicts that must not run in parallel
- per-action estimated cycles
- total and max-action estimated cycle summaries

This command is a policy consumer for tooling and CI. It does not claim
consensus-level scheduling enforcement by itself.

Small experiments can be compiled as single `.cell` files. Once a contract has
more than one source file, a dependency, or a release target, use a package.

A package gives the compiler a stable place to find the entry file, build
settings, dependencies, and lockfile. That makes builds repeatable for you, and
reviewable for someone else.

## What You Will Learn

- how to create a package;
- what belongs in `Cell.toml`;
- how to build, check, format, and document a package;
- which reports are useful during review;
- where the current package workflow intentionally stops.

## Create a Package

Create an application-style package:

```bash
cellc init my_contract
cd my_contract
```

This creates a `Cell.toml` manifest and a source entry. Use this form when you
want a contract package with a concrete entry.

Create a library-style package:

```bash
cellc init my_lib --lib
```

Ask for a machine-readable summary when scripting:

```bash
cellc init my_contract --json
```

## Read The Manifest

A minimal manifest looks like this:

```toml
[package]
name = "my_contract"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
entry = "src/main.cell"

[build]
target = "riscv64-elf"
target_profile = "ckb"
out_dir = "build"

[dependencies]
my_lib = { path = "../my_lib" }
```

Read the manifest as a build promise:

- `entry` tells the compiler where the package starts;
- `target` chooses assembly or ELF-style output;
- `target_profile` chooses the runtime assumptions;
- `out_dir` chooses where artifacts are written;
- path dependencies keep local packages explicit.

Registry publishing and registry dependency resolution are intentionally
experimental/fail-closed until a trusted registry path is ready. Local path
dependencies are the supported workflow for repeatable local development.

When registry resolution is enabled, `cellc add` must remain a dependency
resolver, not a code-snippet finder. Anything reachable by `cellc add` must be
safe to participate in the package, build, deployment, or declared TCB identity
chain. Template-only material belongs behind copy/scaffold commands instead.

## Build

Run the package build:

```bash
cellc build
```

Useful flags:

```bash
cellc build --target riscv64-asm
cellc build --target riscv64-elf
cellc build --target-profile ckb
cellc build --production
cellc build --json
```

`build` reads `Cell.toml`, compiles the current package entry, and writes the
artifact plus metadata sidecar under the configured output directory.

For a one-off source file, use the top-level compiler form instead:

```bash
cellc path/to/file.cell
```

That form is great for quick experiments. Packages are better when you need
repeatability.

## Check Without Writing Artifacts

Use `check` when you want fast feedback:

```bash
cellc check
cellc check --all-targets
cellc check --target-profile ckb
cellc check --production
cellc check --deny-runtime-obligations
cellc check --json
```

`check --all-targets` is useful before committing. It catches source and profile
problems without producing build artifacts.

## Format And Generate Docs

Format the package:

```bash
cellc fmt
cellc fmt --check
cellc fmt --json
```

Generate package docs:

```bash
cellc doc
cellc doc --json
```

Generated docs summarize modules, actions, resources, receipts, locks,
flow rules, and lowering metadata.

## Audit And Evidence Reports

When a package is ready for review, ask the compiler for the facts it already
knows:

```bash
cellc metadata . --target riscv64-elf --target-profile ckb -o build/main.metadata.json
cellc constraints . --target riscv64-elf --target-profile ckb -o build/main.constraints.json
cellc abi . --target-profile ckb
cellc scheduler-plan . --target-profile ckb --json
cellc opt-report . --target riscv64-elf --target-profile ckb --json
```

For CKB-specific builder and deployment review:

```bash
cellc constraints . --target riscv64-elf --target-profile ckb --json
cellc abi . --target-profile ckb --action transfer
cellc entry-witness . --target-profile ckb --action transfer --json
cellc ckb-hash --file build/main.elf
cellc verify-artifact build/main.elf --expect-target-profile ckb --verify-sources --production
```

These reports are not busywork. They answer questions reviewers will ask:

- what is the entry ABI;
- what witness layout is expected;
- what capacity or runtime obligations remain;
- what CKB hash policy is being used;
- whether the artifact still matches the source and metadata.

They do not replace chain acceptance reports, builder-generated transactions,
occupied-capacity evidence, or CKB production gates.

## Local Dependencies

Add a local dependency:

```bash
cellc add my_lib --path ../my_lib
```

`add --path` records the dependency in `Cell.toml`. To resolve the dependency
graph and write `Cell.lock`, run:

```bash
cellc install
```

You can also add and lock a local dependency in one command:

```bash
cellc install my_lib --path ../my_lib
```

Git dependencies must be pinned to a full commit hash:

```bash
cellc add math --git https://example.com/math.git --rev 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
cellc install math --git https://example.com/math.git --rev 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
```

Branch, tag, and default-branch git dependencies are rejected because they can
move without changing `Cell.toml`.

Remove it:

```bash
cellc remove my_lib
```

`install`, `update`, and normal dependency removal refresh the lockfile so
direct and transitive local path dependencies stay consistent.

## Registry Resolver Boundaries

CellScript's registry design follows the same split as the package identity
model:

- package identity answers which source was referenced;
- build identity answers which artifact and metadata were produced;
- deployment identity answers which CKB Cell, CellDep, or runtime artifact is
  being used.

Registry discovery can be broad. It may index CellScript source packages,
runtime verifiers, deployed CKB artifacts, reproducible artifacts, and even
external CKB tooling artifacts such as bootstrapper outputs. Resolver profiles
must stay narrower: an object can be discovered without being installable by
`cellc add`.

That means registry resolution is stricter than discovery. The future resolver
path should accept only objects that can be checked fail-closed:

| Kind | `cellc add` | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `source_package` / library | yes | Source and API identity must be pinned and reproducible. |
| `runtime_verifier` / `spawn-verifier` | yes | TCB object; requires verifier ID, ABI, artifact identity, build profile, security status, and production deployment pins when used in production. |
| `deployable_contract` | yes | Must expose build/audit/deployment identity, not just source text. |
| `deployed_artifact_record` | yes | Must bind network, OutPoint, dep type, code/data hash, and status. |
| `reproducible_artifact` | yes, if artifact-safe | Must bind source hash, build profile hash, artifact hash, and compatibility profile. |
| `protocol_profile_library` | yes, if resolver-safe | Must be a real package with checkable source/schema/API semantics. |
| `template`, `cookbook`, `protocol_skeleton`, scaffold | no | Copy-only starting material; after copying, it becomes local project code. |

The rule is intentionally blunt:

```text
Discovery can be broad; dependency resolution is narrow.

Anything reachable by cellc add must be dependency-safe, artifact-safe,
deployment-fact-safe, or declared-TCB-safe.

Anything scaffold-only must be copied, not resolved.
```

For example, a BIP340 verifier package can have no business parameters and
still be resolver-safe because it is a runtime verifier artifact. Its manifest
or registry record must identify the verifier capability, IPC ABI, artifact
hashes, build profile, TCB/security status, and any production CellDep pins.

A NovaSeal starter project, by contrast, is not dependency-safe merely because
it contains useful `.cell` code. If users are expected to copy it and edit terms,
authorities, manifests, or deployment pins, it belongs in a cookbook or template
flow such as:

```bash
cellc new my_agreement --template novaseal/mvb-starter
cellc cookbook copy novaseal/agreement-profile ./my-agreement
```

It should not be installed with:

```bash
cellc add novaseal/mvb-starter
```

This keeps the registry as a verifiable dependency and artifact discovery layer,
not a general examples marketplace.

## Package Information

```bash
cellc info
cellc info --json
```

Use `info` when you want a quick view of the package boundary before building or
debugging dependency resolution.

## Experimental Commands

Registry publishing, registry package installation, `login`, `run`, and `repl`
remain experimental/future-facing. Local `install --path` and `update` are
supported as lockfile helpers for local path dependency workflows.

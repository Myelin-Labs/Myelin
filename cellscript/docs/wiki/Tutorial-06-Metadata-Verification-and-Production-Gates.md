# Tutorial 06: Metadata Verification and Production Gates

Every CellScript artifact should be treated as a pair:

```text
artifact
artifact.meta.json
```

The artifact is executable RISC-V assembly or ELF. The metadata sidecar is the
explanation: source identity, target profile, artifact hash, schema layout,
runtime requirements, scheduler information, and verifier obligations.

This chapter is about trust boundaries. It teaches you what compiler evidence
can prove, and where you still need CKB transaction evidence.

## The Main Rule

Compiler verification is necessary, but it is not the same thing as a deployed
transaction or chain acceptance report.

If `verify-artifact` passes, you know the artifact and metadata agree. You do
not yet know that a transaction builder can provide the right inputs, serialize
the right witness, satisfy capacity, pass dry-run, and commit.

That distinction prevents overclaiming.

## Emit Metadata

Compile normally:

```bash
cellc build --json
```

Or request metadata directly:

```bash
cellc metadata src/main.cell --target riscv64-elf --target-profile ckb -o /tmp/main.meta.json
```

Open the metadata when something is unclear. It is often easier to understand a
compiler decision by reading the emitted facts than by guessing from the source
alone.

## Verify an Artifact

Start with the basic check:

```bash
cellc verify-artifact build/main.elf
```

Pin the target profile:

```bash
cellc verify-artifact build/main.elf --expect-target-profile ckb
```

Verify source units on disk:

```bash
cellc verify-artifact build/main.elf --verify-sources
```

Use production checks when preparing release evidence:

```bash
cellc verify-artifact build/main.elf --production
cellc verify-artifact build/main.elf --deny-fail-closed
cellc verify-artifact build/main.elf --deny-runtime-obligations
```

Read this gate narrowly: it verifies the artifact, metadata, source hash
expectations, and selected policy flags. It does not prove that a concrete CKB
transaction has been built, deployed, dry-run, indexed, or measured.

## Check Before Build

Use check mode for CI and local feedback:

```bash
cellc check --all-targets --production
cellc check --target-profile ckb --json
```

Important policy flags:

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--production` | Reject unsafe or incomplete lowering paths. |
| `--deny-fail-closed` | Reject metadata that contains fail-closed runtime features or obligations. |
| `--deny-ckb-runtime` | Reject CKB runtime features when they are not allowed for the workflow. |
| `--deny-runtime-obligations` | Reject runtime-required verifier obligations. |

These flags are useful because they turn "remember to inspect this later" into a
compiler-visible failure.

## What To Inspect First

You do not need to memorize the whole sidecar. Start with these fields:

- `target_profile`
- `artifact_format`
- `artifact_hash`
- `artifact_size_bytes`
- `source_hash`
- `source_content_hash`
- `source_units`
- `metadata_schema_version`
- `source_metadata_schema_version`
- `artifact_metadata_schema_version`
- `constraints_metadata_schema_version`
- `actions`
- `locks`
- `schema`
- `runtime`
- `verifier_obligations`
- `runtime.proof_plan`
- `runtime.proof_plan_soundness`
- `runtime.builder_assumptions`
- `template_layouts`
- `constraints`
- `runtime_error_registry`
- `constraints.artifact`
- `constraints.entry_abi`
- `constraints.ckb.capacity_evidence_contract`
- `constraints.ckb.declared_capacity_floors`
- `constraints.ckb.hash_type_policy`
- `constraints.ckb.dep_group_manifest`
- `scheduler`

When reviewing a contract, ask simple questions first:

- which action or lock is the entry;
- what witness does it expect;
- which Cells are consumed or created;
- which runtime obligations remain;
- which CKB profile assumptions are recorded.

The top-level `metadata_schema_version` is the envelope version. The component
schema fields split review risk by surface: source/package identity,
artifact-binding facts, and CKB constraint summaries can now move independently
in future schema revisions. `verify-artifact` still rejects a mismatch in any of
these versions.

## Assurance Layer

CellScript 0.16 added a checked assurance layer over ProofPlan metadata, and
0.21 extends the same evidence stream with ProtocolGraph, TemplateLayout, and
compile receipt binding:

```bash
cellc explain proof src/main.cell --json
cellc explain assumptions src/main.cell --json
cellc tx validate --against build/main.elf.meta.json --tx tx.json --json
```

`runtime.proof_plan_soundness` tells you whether verifier obligations and
ProofPlan records agree. `--primitive-strict=0.16` rejects metadata-only or
runtime-required ProofPlan gaps. The soundness key includes origin/scope,
category, feature, status, and detail; local and runtime ProofPlan records are
compared by full semantic content, including trigger, reads, coverage, and
source spans.

`runtime.builder_assumptions` is the machine-readable contract for transaction
builders. `tx validate` checks a transaction JSON shape against that contract,
rejects bare evidence tokens, and requires indexed evidence objects for
non-structural assumptions before signing. Evidence indexes are range-checked
against the transaction, and concrete fields such as outpoints, hashes,
capacity, dep metadata, witness bytes, and TYPE_ID args must match when present.
This is still pre-chain evidence: dry-run, capacity, cycles, and commit checks
remain required for production claims.

Additional audit reports are available for audit and deployment workflows:

```bash
cellc tx solve src/main.cell --json   # emits can_submit=false template output
cellc explain graph src/main.cell --format mermaid
cellc deploy plan src/main.cell --json
cellc proof-diff old.meta.json new.meta.json --json
cellc audit-bundle src/main.cell --output target/audit
```

## 0.21 Compile Receipts

Compile receipts bind the same evidence stream to deterministic hashes:

```bash
cellc receipt src/main.cell --output target/main.receipt.json
cellc sign-receipt target/main.receipt.json --role publisher --key publisher.ed25519.pkcs8
cellc verify-receipt target/main.receipt.json \
  --metadata target/main.elf.meta.json \
  --artifact target/main.elf
cellc verify-artifact target/main.elf --receipt target/main.receipt.json
```

Receipt signatures authenticate metadata/artifact evidence and derived report
hashes. They do not prove transaction validity, live-cell freshness, dry-run
success, capacity sufficiency, or successful submission.

## 0.21 TemplateLayout Metadata

`template_layouts` is metadata-only in the current compiler: records are derived
from resource/shared/receipt type metadata, use a `Flat` layout by default, and
set `consensus_checked = false` until a backend verifier explicitly enforces a
template commitment. Cyclic flow state machines are marked with
`cycle_policy = RootRequired`; acyclic layouts use `PathOnlyAllowed`.

The compiler rejects unsupported `consensus_checked = true` claims in this RC.
That keeps TemplateLayout from looking consensus-enforced before generated
verifier code actually checks the template commitment.

ProofPlan coverage states are intentionally explicit:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `gap:metadata-only` | The claim is preserved for audit but has no executable verifier coverage. |
| `gap:runtime-helper-required` | The claim maps to a runtime helper, but the selected entry did not emit matching helper coverage. |
| `checked-runtime` | Generated runtime access backs the claim for the selected entry. |

For the review-finding closure matrix, see
`docs/archive/0.17/CELLSCRIPT_0_17_REVIEW_FINDINGS_CLOSURE.md`.

## Suggested Compiler CI Gate

For CKB packages, a useful compiler CI gate is:

```bash
cellc fmt --check
cellc check --target-profile ckb --all-targets --production
cellc build --target riscv64-elf --target-profile ckb --production
cellc verify-artifact build/main.elf --expect-target-profile ckb --verify-sources --production
```

For CKB, make the profile explicit in every step:

```bash
cellc check --target-profile ckb --production
cellc build --target riscv64-elf --target-profile ckb --production
cellc verify-artifact build/main.elf --expect-target-profile ckb --verify-sources --production
```

These gates are suitable for a compiler/package CI loop. They are not enough for
a release claim that says a contract is production-ready on a chain.

## Syntax-Combination Preflight

Syntax and lowering bugs can pass ordinary example compilation when the risky
shape is hidden in an uncommon combination. The reusable syntax-combination
audit exists to catch those bugs before chain evidence is generated:

```bash
./scripts/cellscript_syntax_combo_audit.sh quick
./scripts/cellscript_syntax_combo_audit.sh ci
```

The syntax-combination audit is a release acceptance preflight. It exercises
parser, formatter, type checking, lowering, metadata, codegen, and negative
obsolete-syntax oracles with compact reports under
`target/syntax-combo-audit/`.

For CellScript releases, `quick` is part of the pre-push gate and `ci` runs
before builder-backed CKB acceptance. A direct CKB acceptance run does not
replace this preflight because it only proves selected concrete transactions.

## Unified Gate Entry Points

For repository work, use the unified gate wrapper instead of hand-picking
component scripts:

```bash
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh dev
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh ci
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh backend
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh release
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh release-quick
```

`dev` is the local fast path. `ci` is the pull-request gate. `backend` is for
IR/codegen/RISC-V changes. `release` is the production CKB evidence gate.
`release-quick` is a compile-only release preflight, not external live/devnet
evidence. See `docs/CELLSCRIPT_GATE_POLICY.md` for the exact command contract.

## CKB Release Evidence Gate

When you are ready to make a CKB production claim, move from compiler evidence
to chain evidence. Run the CKB acceptance gate from the CellScript repository
root:

```bash
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh release
```

For pre-push checks, the development gate runs the compiler checks, strict
backend quick audit, syntax-combination quick audit, and diff checks:

```bash
./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh dev
```

If you specifically need the old compile-only production acceptance pass,
`./scripts/cellscript_ckb_release_gate.sh quick` remains supported and delegates
to `./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh release-quick`. The legacy
`./scripts/cellscript_ckb_release_gate.sh full` command is also supported as a
compatibility wrapper for `./scripts/cellscript_gate.sh release`. The production
mode is the release-facing gate because it first runs compiler and
backend-contract evidence, then runs builder-backed local CKB transactions and
stateful scenario/action coverage.

The CKB validator records primitive-strict original bundled-example coverage,
including strict v0.16 PP0150 fail-closed records, then requires scoped action
and lock compile coverage, builder-backed action runs, source-bound acceptance provenance,
builder-backed lock valid-spend and invalid-spend matrices, valid
transaction dry-runs, committed valid transactions, malformed rejection,
measured cycles, consensus-serialized transaction size, occupied-capacity evidence,
exact-artifact build reports, live code-cell data-hash linkage, no
under-capacity outputs, bundled example deployment, and a passed final
production hardening gate. Fail-closed PP0150 records are evidence of a strict
boundary, not deployable production acceptance.

The report must explicitly record a passed final production hardening gate and
source provenance for the repository commit, tracked source file list, tracked
source hash, acceptance runner hash, and evidence validator hash. It must also
record `cellscript_build_reports`: each row binds the compiled RISC-V ELF,
`verify-artifact` result, ELF entry ABI result, CKB data hash, and any live
devnet code-cell deployment whose data hash equals that compiled artifact hash.
Compile-only reports keep the live deployment list empty and are not external
release evidence.

For the current NovaSeal profile set, production-ready source-package evidence
means the live local devnet runners pass for core, Agreement, and the six
planned profiles: BTC transaction commitment, BTC UTXO seal, dual seal, Fiber
candidate, Fungible xUDT, and RWA receipt. Public/mainnet deployment evidence is
separate: profile docs must still name any required CellDep attestation,
external BIP340 TCB review, public BTC SPV/indexer report, or RWA legal/registry
review.

The production gate compiles the seven production checked-in top-level example
contracts directly: token, NFT, timelock, multisig, vesting, AMM pool, and
launch. Those files are the single canonical production business source and the
cleaner reading surface; there are no checked-in `examples/business` or
`examples/acceptance` mirrors. Acceptance-only profile/effect/scheduler
metadata belongs in runner configuration or generated files under `target/`.

Lock behavior coverage is machine-readable through
`lock_acceptance_scope.onchain_lock_spend_matrix_scope`; each listed lock must
have both valid-spend and invalid-spend evidence.

`examples/registry.cell`, `examples/atomic_swap.cell`,
`examples/multi_phase_dao.cell`, and every checked-in `examples/language/*.cell`
file are non-production examples covered by compiler/tooling tests, not by the
bundled CKB production matrix.

`--compile-only` and bounded diagnostic runs can help development, but they are
not external production release evidence.

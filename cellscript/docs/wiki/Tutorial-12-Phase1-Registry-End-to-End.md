# Phase 1 Registry: End-to-End

This page is a **navigation stub** for the Phase 1 registry
end-to-end tutorial. The full tutorial lives in the repository under
`docs/tutorials/phase1-end-to-end.md` and is the canonical source for
this material.

## What this page is

The wiki hosts short, reader-facing navigation. The Phase 1 tutorial
is long enough that keeping the full text here would drift out of
sync with the canonical repository copy. This page exists so a wiki
reader can find the tutorial through the wiki sidebar without having
to navigate the repository layout directly.

If you are reading this in the wiki and the canonical tutorial is
inaccessible, the tutorial covers:

- the three-file identity model (manifest, build lockfile, deployment
  manifest);
- the three-layer trust model (source identity, build identity,
  deployment identity) and its fail-closed semantics at each layer;
- why Phase 1 does not need a central registry server and how to
  operate fully without GitHub;
- a worked end-to-end example that walks authoring, publishing,
  dependency resolution, building, deployment, and verification.

# CellScript 0.15 Release Notes

**Status**: Released as `v0.15.0`.

**Release date**: 2026-05-26.

**Release tag**: `v0.15.0`.

**GitHub release**:
<https://github.com/a19q3/CellScript/releases/tag/v0.15.0>.

**Updated**: 2026-05-26.

CellScript 0.15 is the scoped-invariant, Covenant ProofPlan, and verifier
soundness hardening release. It closes the known fail-open and
semantic-boundary bugs found during the hardening audit, makes verifier
triggers, scope, coverage, builder assumptions, and enforcement gaps explicit
in source and metadata, and promotes cell identity into a first-class primitive
while resetting the capability vocabulary from protocol verbs to kernel
effects.

The short version: 0.15 adds scoped invariant declarations, aggregate
assertion primitives, Covenant ProofPlan metadata and `cellc explain-proof`,
first-class cell identity policies, explicit destruction policies, a
kernel/protocol primitive split, expression-local unsigned widening, a
compat/strict migration path, semantic-boundary hardening, and renames internal
`type_hash` metadata fields.

0.15 is intentionally a hardening release, not the final boundary architecture.
It blocks the known dangerous cases and introduces the scaffolding required for
0.16, where the same boundaries can become fully type-enforced, CFG-aware, and
coverage-linked.

## Highlights

### Verifier Soundness Hardening

0.15 closes the known high-risk boundary leaks where verifier semantics could
be lowered too early into ordinary low-level values, raw byte spans, raw paths,
or syntax occurrences. The hardening work includes:

- fail-closed paths no longer lowering as ordinary `Return(U64(error))` values;
- runtime/helper and syscall status paths checked before exposing DSL values;
- lock predicate success requiring canonical `bool == 1`;
- Molecule semantic field access gated by containing-layout canonicality;
- branch-local and duplicate lifecycle effects conservatively rejected until
  CFG-aware resource summaries are complete;
- package/dependency paths contained inside their declared capability roots;
- const initializers restricted to compile-time-safe expressions;
- initial `SyscallSpec`, IR status-boundary, validated schema planning,
  `ResourceEffectSummary`, and ProofPlan executable-evidence scaffolding.

This is a hardening release. It does not claim full first-class status typing,
full SyscallSpec migration, CFG lifecycle merging, or complete source-to-runtime
ProofPlan evidence linking.

### Scoped Invariant Syntax

0.15 adds first-class invariant declarations with explicit trigger, scope,
and reads:

```cellscript
invariant udt_amount_non_increase {
    trigger: type_group
    scope: group
    reads: group_inputs<Token>.amount, group_outputs<Token>.amount

    assert_sum(group_outputs<Token>.amount) <= assert_sum(group_inputs<Token>.amount)
}
```

Supported triggers: `explicit_entry`, `lock_group`, `type_group`.
Supported scopes: `selected_cells`, `group`, `transaction`.

Invariants are preserved through AST, type checking, IR, module metadata,
formatting, LSP symbols, hover/completions, docs, and scoped CKB entry
compilation.

### Aggregate Invariant Primitives

0.15 adds scoped aggregate assertion primitives for common covenant-style
relations:

```cellscript
assert_sum(group_outputs<Token>.amount) <= assert_sum(group_inputs<Token>.amount)
assert_conserved(Token.amount, scope = group)
assert_delta(Token.amount, witness.delta, scope = selected_cells)
assert_distinct(outputs<NFT>.token_id, scope = transaction)
assert_singleton(Config.config_id, scope = group)
```

Aggregate fields must resolve to fixed-width integer or fixed-byte schema
fields. Dynamic tables, generic collections, and bool fields are rejected.
Non-literal `assert_delta` arguments must be bound through `reads` to
`witness.*` or `lock_args.*`, so the runtime delta has an auditable source.

**Boundary**: Aggregate primitives are currently metadata-only for automatic
aggregate verifier-loop lowering. They emit `codegen_coverage_status:
"gap:metadata-only"` and `status: "runtime-required"` until a later lowering
pass proves them on chain. 0.15 now also cross-references declared aggregate
invariants against checked action obligations; matched obligations are reported
as bounded action coverage, while unmatched declarations remain visible and
gateable.

### Covenant ProofPlan Metadata

0.15 adds a `ProofPlan` stage and `cellc explain-proof` audit surface.
Runtime, action, function, and lock metadata expose ProofPlan records with:

- invariant name and source span
- trigger, scope, reads, coverage
- input/output relation checks
- group cardinality
- identity/lifecycle policy
- builder assumptions
- diagnostics and codegen coverage status
- matched/unmatched invariant action coverage

`cellc explain-proof` prints trigger/scope/reads/coverage/on-chain status in
human-readable and JSON output.

`ScriptArgs` and `lock_args` provenance is reported under `reads.lock_args`,
not `reads.witness`; witness remains reserved for transaction witness data.

`cellc check --deny-runtime-obligations` rejects runtime-required ProofPlan
gaps, including declared invariants whose coverage is still metadata-only or
whose action coverage is unmatched.

Production and strict gates also reject records that claim checked runtime
coverage without executable evidence. Static or metadata-only details such as
`checked-static` do not populate executable runtime/codegen evidence.

Lock-group transaction risk diagnostics warn when a `lock_group` verifier
scans transaction-wide views, because only inputs sharing that lock trigger
the verifier.

### Expression-local Unsigned Widening

0.15 defines a deliberately bounded coercion rule for primitive unsigned
integers. CellScript may widen `u8 -> u16 -> u32 -> u64 -> u128` only inside
arithmetic and numeric comparison expressions.

This is not a general implicit numeric coercion feature. Assignment, return,
ABI, witness, `create` layout, struct field initialization, Molecule layout,
and serialization boundaries remain exact-type boundaries. Integer literals may
be context-typed by an expected primitive integer type, but non-literal values
must use an explicit cast at boundaries:

```cellscript
let total: u64 = amount_u64 + fee_u16 // accepted expression-local widening
let stored: u64 = fee_u16             // rejected boundary widening
let stored: u64 = fee_u16 as u64      // accepted explicit boundary cast
```

Compound assignment is a write boundary: `target += rhs` is valid only when
`rhs` is the same width as, or narrower than, `target`. Generic `u128`
arithmetic and ordering remain unsupported except for explicitly implemented
`u128` delta and equality paths.

### Cell Identity and TYPE_ID Lifecycle

0.15 promotes cell identity from a metadata annotation into a first-class
primitive policy:

```cellscript
resource Token has store
    identity(ckb_type_id)
{
    amount: u64
}
```

Supported identity policies:

| Policy | Meaning | 0.15 executable boundary |
|--------|---------|--------------------------|
| `identity none` | No identity tracking (default, backward compatible) | No identity verifier is emitted |
| `identity ckb_type_id` | CKB TYPE_ID: derived from first input + output index | `create_unique` requires a TYPE_ID output plan and reports global creation uniqueness as runtime-required; `replace_unique` preserves TypeHash |
| `identity field(path)` | Fixed-width field identity within the data payload | `create_unique` anchors the output field bytes and reports global uniqueness as runtime-required; `replace_unique` compares input/output field bytes |
| `identity script_args` | Identity derived from the executing script args | `create_unique` anchors the output LockHash and reports global uniqueness as runtime-required; `replace_unique` preserves LockHash |
| `identity singleton_type` | Singleton type identity | `create_unique` anchors the output TypeHash and reports singleton creation exclusivity as runtime-required; `replace_unique` preserves TypeHash |

Identity-aware lifecycle forms:

```cellscript
// Identity-aware creation
let minted = create_unique<Token>(identity = ckb_type_id) {
    amount: 100
} with_lock(recipient)

// Identity-aware replacement (consumes input, preserves identity)
let updated = replace_unique<Token>(identity = ckb_type_id) old {
    amount: old.amount - 50
}
```

`IrInstruction::CreateUnique` and `IrInstruction::ReplaceUnique` carry
identity metadata through the full compile pipeline. `TypeMetadata.identity_policy`
exposes the policy in compiled JSON metadata (hidden when `none`).

`replace_unique` has the syntax
`replace_unique<T>(identity = policy) input_cell { ... }`; the input operand is
required because the verifier compares the consumed Cell with the replacement
output. It does not take a `with_lock(...)` clause.

For `create_unique` policies, 0.15 emits local runtime anchors for the created
output and records the full global uniqueness proof as `runtime-required`.
For `ckb_type_id`, the remaining boundary is the TYPE_ID builder plan. For
field-, script-args-, and singleton-type creation, global uniqueness remains a
builder/indexer responsibility outside the CKB-VM execution scope.

### Explicit Destruction Policies

0.15 adds policy-specific destruction forms so the compiler and verifier know
*what is being proved*:

| Form | What it proves |
|------|---------------|
| `destroy_singleton_type(cell)` | No output with the same TypeHash exists |
| `destroy_unique(cell, identity = type_id)` | TYPE_ID continuation absence, lowered through the same output TypeHash scan |
| `destroy_instance(cell, identity_field = id)` | A field-identified instance destruction intent; full same-field output scan is runtime-required |
| `burn_amount(cell, field = amount)` | Quantity-delta burn intent; executable delta proof is runtime-required |

Bare `destroy cell` still compiles as `DestructionPolicy::Default`. In strict
mode it must be authorized by the 0.15 kernel effects `consume + burn` instead
of the legacy `has destroy` capability. Use a policy-specific form when the
audit needs to distinguish singleton absence, TYPE_ID consumption,
field-identified instance consumption, or amount burn.

`IrInstruction::Destroy` now carries `policy: IrDestructionPolicy` through
IR and codegen. Codegen only emits the legacy same-TypeHash absence scan for
singleton/type-id destruction policies; instance and amount policies are
reported as runtime-required instead of being over-constrained as singleton
absence.

### Kernel/Protocol Primitive Split

0.15 splits resource capabilities into kernel effects and protocol verbs.

New kernel-effect capabilities in `has ...` clauses:

```cellscript
resource Token has store, create, consume, replace, burn, relock, retarget_type, read_ref
```

These are context-sensitive identifiers: they are only treated as capability
keywords inside `has ...` clauses and remain ordinary identifiers elsewhere
(e.g., `action burn(token: Token)` compiles normally).

`Capability::is_protocol_verb()` and `Capability::kernel_effects()` classify
capabilities for migration tooling. `transfer` and `destroy` are protocol
verbs in 0.15; their effects decompose as:

```text
transfer  -> consume + create + relock (+ replace if lock changes)
destroy   -> consume + burn (or consume + assert_absence)
```

### Capability Vocabulary Reset and Compat/Strict Modes

0.15 provides a migration path from the v0.14 capability vocabulary:

**Compatibility mode** (`--primitive-compat=0.14`):
- accepts `has transfer` and `has destroy` without errors
- existing examples compile unchanged

**Strict mode** (`--primitive-strict=0.15`):
- rejects `has transfer` with diagnostic CS0150
- rejects `has destroy` with diagnostic CS0151
- requires kernel-effect capabilities and explicit destruction policies

Top-level single-file compilation accepts the same primitive migration flags as
package subcommands, so this works for direct example inspection:

```bash
cellc examples/token.cell --target riscv64-elf --target-profile ckb --primitive-strict 0.15
```

Direct lifecycle checks accept the 0.15 kernel-effect equivalents:
`transfer` accepts `replace + relock`; `destroy` accepts `consume + burn`.

Migration diagnostics (CS0150–CS0160) provide old syntax, new syntax, and
affected proof obligations.

### Internal Metadata Renaming

Public metadata fields that previously used `type_hash` ambiguously are now
explicit about which CKB hash domain they refer to:

| Old name | New name |
|----------|----------|
| `type_hash-absence` | `ckb_type_script_hash-absence` |
| `type_hash-preservation` | `ckb_type_script_hash-preservation` |
| `lock_hash-preservation` | `ckb_lock_script_hash-preservation` |

### Protocol Macro Provenance

ProofPlan coverage records include macro provenance for selected
compiler-recognized flows such as `transfer`, `create`, `claim`, `settle`,
`consume`, `destroy`, and pool protocol metadata. This is audit metadata;
it is not a replacement for builder-backed CKB transaction evidence.

### Runtime-Obligation Policy Gate

`cellc check --deny-runtime-obligations` rejects runtime-required ProofPlan
gaps, including declared invariants whose coverage is still metadata-only or
whose action coverage is unmatched.

## New Syntax Reference

### Type Declaration Identity

```cellscript
resource Token has store
    identity(ckb_type_id)      // CKB TYPE_ID
{
    amount: u64
}

shared OracleData
    identity(script_args)       // Script.args identity
{
    value: u64
}

resource NFT has store
    identity(field(token_id))   // Field-based identity
{
    token_id: [u8; 32]
    owner: Address
}
```

Default is `identity none` (no tracking); backward compatible.

### Identity-Aware Lifecycle Forms

```cellscript
// create_unique — identity-aware cell creation
let token = create_unique<Token>(identity = ckb_type_id) {
    amount: 100
} with_lock(recipient)

// create_unique with a field identity
let nft = create_unique<NFT>(identity = field(token_id)) {
    token_id,
    owner
} with_lock(owner)

// replace_unique - identity-aware replacement (consumes input)
let updated = replace_unique<Token>(identity = ckb_type_id) token {
    amount: token.amount - 10
}

let moved = replace_unique<NFT>(identity = field(token_id)) nft {
    token_id: nft.token_id,
    owner: new_owner
}
```

### Destruction Policy Forms

```cellscript
// Prove no same-TypeHash output exists
destroy_singleton_type(token)

// Prove TYPE_ID identity is consumed (not replaced)
destroy_unique(token, identity = type_id)

// Prove a specific instance is consumed (allow other same-type outputs)
destroy_instance(token, identity_field = id)

// Prove quantity delta (burn)
burn_amount(token, field = amount)
```

### Capability Vocabulary

```cellscript
// v0.14 (compat mode: --primitive-compat=0.14)
resource Token has store, transfer, destroy { ... }

// v0.15 (strict mode: --primitive-strict=0.15)
resource Token has store, create, consume, replace, burn, relock { ... }
```

### Aggregate Invariant Syntax

```cellscript
invariant conservation {
    trigger: type_group
    scope: group
    reads: group_inputs<Token>.amount, group_outputs<Token>.amount

    assert_sum(group_outputs<Token>.amount) == assert_sum(group_inputs<Token>.amount)
}

invariant no_duplicate_nft {
    trigger: type_group
    scope: transaction
    reads: outputs<NFT>.token_id

    assert_distinct(outputs<NFT>.token_id, scope = transaction)
}
```

## Intentional Boundaries

0.15 does not include:

- automatic executable verifier-loop lowering for aggregate invariants
  (aggregate records remain metadata-only; existing action checks may be
  cross-referenced but are not formal aggregate lowering);
- full SyscallSpec coverage for every runtime, env, header, input, hash,
  Molecule, memory, and internal helper;
- first-class IR type separation for every `Bool`, `DomainU64`, `ErrorCode`,
  `ExitStatus`, `SyscallStatus`, and `HelperStatus` flow;
- CFG-aware lifecycle effect merging for mutually exclusive branches;
- a hard Rust API gate that makes raw Molecule span helpers impossible to call
  from semantic field access paths;
- complete source-obligation to IR/codegen/runtime ProofPlan coverage linking;
- automatic constraint placement between lock and type;
- complete formal invariant satisfaction checking across all action effects
  (v0.16 scope);
- covenant helper stdlib;
- Address/LockScript/LockHash type split;
- explicit CKB script role declarations;
- versioned cell data layout policies;
- removal of claim/receipt name heuristics;
- explicit mutation cardinality forms;
- `shared` as a scheduler policy library;
- global uniqueness proof for `create_unique(...)`; 0.15 emits local runtime
  anchors and reports the full uniqueness proof as runtime-required;
- full ProofPlan soundness checks (v0.16 scope).

## Future Direction: 0.16 Enforced Boundary Architecture

In 0.15, invariants are treated as declared ProofPlan obligations rather than
implicitly executed verifier functions. This is intentional: an invariant is
only sound when its trigger, scope, reads, and CKB script boundary are explicit.

The next step is invariant satisfaction checking. A declared invariant should be
considered production-satisfied only if one of the following holds:

1. it has been lowered into executable verifier code;
2. it is matched by a checked action obligation with compatible trigger, scope,
   type, field, and relation coverage;
3. it is rejected by strict or production gates as runtime-required.

Aggregate primitives such as `assert_sum`, `assert_conserved`, `assert_delta`,
`assert_distinct`, and `assert_singleton` are the first candidates for
executable lowering, because their fixed-width field restrictions already
provide a bounded ABI and scanner shape.

The 0.16 theme is moving from boundary scaffolding to enforced architecture:
all runtime and stdlib helpers should derive from a shared SyscallSpec,
status-like values should be impossible to treat as domain values, semantic
schema access should require validated field objects, lifecycle effects should
merge through CFG-aware summaries, and ProofPlan claims should cite concrete
IR/codegen/runtime evidence IDs.

## Summary

CellScript 0.15 closes known fail-open and semantic-boundary issues, adds
negative regression coverage, and introduces the boundary scaffolding required
for 0.16's deeper architecture cleanup. Scoped invariants declare when the
verifier runs, what it reads, and which cells it protects. Cell identity is now
a first-class primitive with `create_unique`/`replace_unique` lifecycle forms
and runtime identity anchors/preservation checks. Destruction policies make it
explicit whether you are proving output absence, identity continuation, or
quantity delta. The capability vocabulary has been reset from protocol verbs
to kernel effects, with a compat/strict migration path. Covenant ProofPlan
metadata and `cellc explain-proof` give auditors a complete
trigger/scope/reads/coverage/on-chain view, while the remaining type-enforced
boundary architecture is explicitly deferred to 0.16.

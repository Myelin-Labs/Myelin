# CellScript VS Code Extension

Production-grade VS Code tooling for `.cell` contracts, powered by a
CellScript Language Server (`cellc --lsp` over stdio).

The extension connects to a `cellc` binary running as a JSON-RPC language
server over stdio. This provides real-time diagnostics, completion, hover,
go-to-definition, find-references, rename, signature help, document
highlighting, folding, formatting, code actions, and document symbols —
all backed by the CellScript compiler's parser, type-checker, and
lowering pipeline.

CLI-backed commands (compile, metadata, constraints, ABI, action build plans,
builder generation, package verification, registry verification, and production
report) continue to spawn `cellc` directly for one-shot operations that are
outside the LSP scope.

## Features

### LSP-powered (via `cellc --lsp`)

- real-time diagnostics on open / edit / save with incremental sync
- context-aware completion (keywords, types, user symbols, fields, locals)
- hover information (types, lowering metadata, lifecycle states)
- go-to-definition (top-level symbols, fields, local variables, cross-module)
- find-references (lexer-accurate, skips comments and strings)
- rename (cross-module, respects identifier boundaries)
- signature help (action, function, lock parameters)
- document highlight
- folding ranges
- selection ranges
- document symbols
- code actions (lowering diagnostics quickfix)
- document formatting

### CLI-backed

- compile to a scratch artifact for the configured RISC-V target
- `cellc metadata` JSON report
- `cellc constraints` JSON report
- `cellc abi` entry witness ABI report
- `cellc action build --json` action transaction-builder contract
- `cellc gen-builder --target typescript` generated action-builder package
- `cellc package verify --json` package/source/lockfile integrity report
- `cellc registry verify --json` deployment identity report
- `cellc registry verify --live --json` optional CKB RPC live-cell proof
- production report (version + metadata + constraints)
- CKB target-profile arguments for compiler-backed reports

### Editor basics

- `.cell` file association
- TextMate syntax highlighting for the current canonical action model
  (`verification` sections, action-level `transition input -> output` /
  `transition input.state: A -> output.state: B`, `flow`, named output
  `create out = T { ... }`, and source qualifiers such as `read`, `protected`,
  `witness`, and `lock_args`)
- comment, bracket, auto-close, and folding configuration
- snippets for resources, shared state, receipts, flows, action proof blocks,
  field-to-field state transitions, locks, source-qualified parameters, effects,
  named output `create ... = ... with_lock`, anonymous `require` blocks,
  `preserve` blocks, and stdlib lifecycle/cell metadata helpers
- 0.14 lock-boundary snippets and highlighting for `protected`, `lock_args`,
  `witness`, `require`, `source::*`, `witness::*`, and `env::sighash_all`
- status bar state indicator

## Canonical Authoring Surface

The extension snippets and grammar follow the signature-direction action
surface:

```cellscript
action fill_offer(input: Offer) -> output: Offer {
    transition input.state: Live -> output.state: Filled

    verification
        require output.price == input.price
        require output.seller == input.seller
}
```

Use `verification` sections for action and lock proof logic.

At action and lock boundaries, source qualifiers are written before the
parameter name:

```cellscript
action grant(read config: Config, tokens: Token) -> grant: Grant {
    verification
        create grant = Grant { admin: config.admin }
}

lock owner_only(protected cell: Wallet, witness owner: Address) -> bool {
    verification
        require owner == cell.owner
}
```

`create output = T { ... }` constrains a named proposed output Cell. It is
not runtime allocation. Expression-level `read_ref<T>()` still exists for
lower-level reference reads, but action-boundary read-only Cell parameters
should use `read name: T`.

## Architecture

```
VS Code ──(LanguageClient)──> cellc --lsp ──(JSON-RPC)──> CellScriptBackend
```

The `CellScriptBackend` in `server.rs` wraps the in-process `LspServer` and
implements the `tower_lsp::LanguageServer` trait. Document changes use
incremental sync; diagnostics are pushed automatically after each
open/change event.

## Requirements

Install `cellc` and make it available on `PATH`, or set
`cellscript.compilerPath` to the full compiler path.

When developing inside the CellScript Rust workspace, the extension can
fall back to:

```bash
cargo run -q -p cellscript --
```

Set `cellscript.useCargoRunFallback` to `false` to disable that fallback.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CellScript: Compile Current File` | Compile the active file to a scratch RISC-V assembly artifact and print compiler output. |
| `CellScript: Show Metadata` | Run `cellc metadata` for the active file and show JSON in the CellScript output channel. |
| `CellScript: Show Constraints` | Run `cellc constraints` for the active file and show JSON in the CellScript output channel. |
| `CellScript: Show Entry Witness ABI` | Select an action or lock, then run `cellc abi` for the active file or package and show the `_cellscript_entry` witness ABI. |
| `CellScript: Show Action Build Plan` | Select an action, then run `cellc action build --json` for the active file or package and show the builder contract. |
| `CellScript: Generate TypeScript Action Builder` | Run `cellc gen-builder --target typescript` and write the generated package to `cellscript.builderOutputDir`. |
| `CellScript: Verify Package` | Run `cellc package verify --json` from the nearest `Cell.toml` package root. |
| `CellScript: Verify Registry` | Run `cellc registry verify --json` from the nearest `Cell.toml` package root, adding trust metadata flags when configured. |
| `CellScript: Verify Live Registry` | Run `cellc registry verify --live --json`, passing `cellscript.ckbRpcUrl`, `cellscript.deploymentNetwork`, and trust metadata flags when configured. |
| `CellScript: Show Production Report` | Show compiler version, artifact metadata, constraints, and release audit boundaries for the active file. |

Diagnostics, completion, hover, go-to-definition, references, rename,
formatting, signature help, folding, and code actions are provided
automatically by the language server — no explicit commands needed.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `cellscript.compilerPath` | `cellc` | Compiler binary used for the language server and CLI commands. |
| `cellscript.useCargoRunFallback` | `true` | Use workspace `cargo run -q -p cellscript --` if `cellc` is unavailable. |
| `cellscript.commandTimeoutMs` | `15000` | Timeout for compiler-backed CLI commands. |
| `cellscript.maxOutputBytes` | `4194304` | Captured stdout/stderr limit. |
| `cellscript.target` | `riscv64-asm` | Compiler target for compile/metadata/constraints commands. |
| `cellscript.builderOutputDir` | `target/cellscript-builder/typescript` | Generated TypeScript action-builder package directory. Relative paths resolve from the nearest `Cell.toml` package root. |
| `cellscript.ckbRpcUrl` | empty | CKB RPC URL for live registry verification. When empty, `cellc` may use `CELLSCRIPT_CKB_RPC_URL` from the environment. |
| `cellscript.deploymentNetwork` | empty | Optional deployment network filter for live registry verification and generated builder deployment identity binding. |
| `cellscript.registryRequirePublisherSignature` | `false` | Add `--require-publisher-signature` to registry verification commands. This is a metadata-presence gate, not cryptographic signature verification. |
| `cellscript.registryRequireAuditReport` | `false` | Add `--require-audit-report` to registry verification commands. |

## Local Validation

```bash
cd editors/vscode-cellscript
npm run validate
```

The validation script checks the extension manifest, grammar, snippets,
language configuration, commands, settings, and runtime wiring.

## Packaging

```bash
cd editors/vscode-cellscript
npm run package
npm run publish:dry-run
```

`npm run publish:dry-run` builds the extension and writes a disposable VSIX to
`/tmp/cellscript-vscode-dry-run.vsix`; it does not contact the Marketplace.
Generated `.vsix` files are ignored by git and excluded from packaged source
archives.

## Release Review Checklist

For production release review, use `CellScript: Show Production Report` and
check the JSON/prose output for:

- compiler version pin;
- artifact metadata and artifact hash;
- schema hash and ABI/schema metadata;
- constraints hash or constraints JSON saved by the build;
- build provenance and source hash fields;
- target profile and entry-action/entry-lock scope;
- package and deployment identity verification through `Cell.lock` and
  `Deployed.toml`;
- generated action-builder package identity, including optional lockfile and
  deployment binding;
- CKB capacity/cycle limits;
- external audit signatures attached by the release process.

The extension displays compiler evidence. It does not create audit signatures,
publish packages, deploy code cells, sign transactions, submit transactions, or
replace CKB acceptance gates.

## Scope

The extension is a stable local editor integration. It is not a debugger, and
it does not replace release gates such as `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`,
`cellc check --production`, or chain acceptance scripts.

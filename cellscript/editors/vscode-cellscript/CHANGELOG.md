# Changelog

## 0.21.0-rc.1

- Aligned the extension package metadata with the CellScript 0.21 release
  candidate.
- Kept the editor command surface on the compiler-backed package, registry,
  builder, ABI, metadata, and production-report commands while the compiler
  adds the 0.21 CLI, MCP, receipt, ProtocolGraph, TemplateLayout, and
  aggregate-helper evidence surfaces.
- Switched builder assumptions, transaction template, and deploy plan commands
  to the canonical nested `cellc explain assumptions`, `cellc tx solve`, and
  `cellc deploy plan` forms.
- Refreshed README wording for the current 0.21 authoring surface.

## 0.20.0

- Added VS Code commands for the 0.20 action-builder workflow:
  entry-witness ABI, action build plans, TypeScript builder generation,
  package verification, registry verification, and live registry verification.
- Added extension settings for generated builder output, CKB RPC URL,
  deployment network filtering, and registry trust metadata gates.
- Aligned editor diagnostics with compiler severity so future warning-level
  diagnostics can be surfaced without being treated as hard compiler errors.
- Reflected split metadata schema versions in compiler-backed reports and
  generated-builder ABI identity.
- Clarified the extension registry boundary: editor commands verify package,
  deployment, live-cell, and trust-metadata evidence, while registry
  publish/install and cryptographic publisher-signature verification remain
  compiler/Git workflow responsibilities.
- Refreshed package metadata and README/validation coverage for the active LSP
  capability set, including workspace rename.

## 0.17.0

- Updated grammar, snippets, and README examples for the canonical
  `verification` action/lock surface and removed the legacy authoring model
  from current guidance.
- Aligned the extension release boundary with the 0.19 grammar-governance
  matrix and syntax-combo known-bug-class gate.
- Updated extension package metadata for the CellScript 0.17.0 nightly line.
- Kept the extension validation manifest aligned with the compiler and
  documentation changes inherited from the 0.16 release branch.

## 0.16.1

- Aligned documentation with the CellScript 0.16.1 release.

## 0.16.0

- Updated extension package metadata for the CellScript 0.16.0 release.
- Kept the extension aligned with `cellc --lsp` while the compiler adds the
  v0.16 assurance surface: ProofPlan soundness, builder assumptions, transaction
  template reports, deployment reports, and audit bundle metadata.
- Added active-file commands for `cellc explain-assumptions`, `solve-tx`,
  `deploy-plan`, `profile`, and `audit-bundle` so the editor command surface
  matches the 0.16 freeze tooling.
- Refreshed README wording for the current 0.16 authoring surface.
- Validated the package against the 0.16 crate version and release manifest.

## 0.15.0

- Updated extension package metadata for the CellScript 0.15.0 release.
- Corrected the documented LSP entrypoint to `cellc --lsp`.
- Aligned README feature claims with the current LSP capabilities; rename stays
  disabled until scoped workspace edits are implemented.
- Added TextMate highlighting, snippets, and validation coverage for 0.15
  identity-aware lifecycle forms, destruction-policy forms, aggregate invariant
  primitives, and kernel capability vocabulary.
- Updated lock snippets for the 0.14 lock-boundary surface:
  `protected`, `lock_args`, `witness`, and `require`.
- Added LSP completions for `lock_args`, CKB source views, witness fields,
  `env::sighash_all`, and CKB epoch/since helpers.
- Extended syntax highlighting for `source::`, `witness::`, `ckb::`, and
  nested `std::...` namespace builtins.

## 0.13.2

- Updated extension package metadata for the CellScript 0.13.2 release.
- Added release-blocking validation for stdlib lifecycle and cell metadata
  snippets: `std::lifecycle::transfer`, `std::receipt::claim`,
  `std::lifecycle::settle`, `std::cell::same_lock`,
  `std::cell::preserve_lock`, and `std::cell::preserve_capacity`.
- Highlight `std::...` namespaces as builtin support namespaces.
- Fixed the publish dry-run script so it performs a local VSIX packaging check
  with a pinned `@vscode/vsce` dependency instead of invoking an unsupported
  Marketplace publish flag.

## 0.13.0

- Updated extension package metadata for the CellScript 0.13 release.
- Added editor completion coverage for the 0.13 Vec helper surface.
- Updated TextMate grammar and snippets for the 0.13 action model:
  signature-direction outputs, `where` proof blocks, colon state transitions,
  `flow`, named output `create out = T { ... }`, and prefix source
  qualifiers (`read`, `protected`, `witness`, `lock_args`).
- Tightened extension validation so stale brace-body action snippets and
  missing 0.13 syntax keywords are release blockers.

## 0.12.0

- Replaced direct CLI diagnostics with a full LSP language server integration
  (`cellc --lsp`) using `vscode-languageclient`.
- LSP-powered features: real-time diagnostics (open/edit/save with incremental
  sync), context-aware completion, hover, go-to-definition, find-references,
  signature help, document highlight, folding ranges, selection ranges, document
  symbols, code actions, and document formatting.
- CLI-backed commands continue to work for compile, metadata, constraints,
  production report, and CKB target-profile arguments.
- Updated extension architecture: VS Code → LanguageClient → `cellc --lsp`
  → `CellScriptBackend` (tower-lsp) → in-process `LspServer`.
- Removed stale validation-mode and validation-debounce settings (diagnostics
  are now driven by the language server, not by CLI polling).
- Updated README to reflect the new LSP architecture.

## 0.11.0

- Promoted the extension from a thin syntax package to stable local editor
  tooling for CellScript authoring.
- Added compiler-backed commands for validation, scratch compilation, metadata,
  constraints, formatting, and target-profile arguments.
- Added `CellScript: Show Production Report`, which combines compiler version,
  artifact metadata, constraints, and release-audit boundary notes for the
  active `.cell` file.
- Documented the transport boundary: this extension is mature local
  compiler-backed tooling, not a standalone JSON-RPC/stdin language-server
  process.
- Added edit-time validation settings, command timeout/output limits, status
  bar feedback, command palette/context menu entries, and stricter manifest
  validation.
- Updated repository metadata to the standalone CellScript repository.

## 0.1.0

- initial CellScript VS Code language extension skeleton
- `.cell` file association
- TextMate syntax highlighting
- language configuration
- basic snippets
